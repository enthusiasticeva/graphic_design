# Graphic Design

In this repository, I have provided examples of some graphic design work I have done for both my degree, as well as my job.

*Note: Permission was received from my employer to share these designs.*

At work (as a dance studio manager), I predominately used canva for my projects. I worked for a dance school called Vibz, which ran a variety of exterally made programmes, like Dance Cirque and Ready Set Dance.
One of the main places I created content for was our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vibzstudio/), which I ran from June 2022 - Decemeber 2023. As well as this social media content, I created a number of other designs, including posters, info packs and concert programmes.
- Sometimes, I was working with style guides. When creating [Ready Set Dance content](/canva%20projects/work%20related%20projects/ready_set_dance/), I had a range of logos, backgrounds and assets, as well as a style guide which provided details of the colours and fonts to use.
- In other instances, like with the [Little Monkeys and Cirque Info packs](/canva%20projects/work%20related%20projects/cirque/), I had very limited style specifications, but had to work to make sure the given logos and photos fit seamlessly into a design of my own making.
- When designing the [general Vibz content](/canva%20projects/work%20related%20projects/vibz/), including concert programs and graphics, all I had to go off was the logo, and so I built out my own style specs from there to ensure the content looked clean and proffesional.

## University Designs
I chose to do a Graphic Design elective as a part of my degree. The subject was [DECO2101: Fundamentals of Visual Design](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/DECO2101). As a part of this subject, I did 3 graphic design projects using Adobe Illustrator
- The [first project](/illustrator%20projects/university%20projects/DECO2101_Task1_ejes2694.pdf) was an analysis of a pre-existing piece of design. The delivery of this analysis was a poster made in illustrator
- The [second project](/illustrator%20projects/university%20projects/timeline.pdf) was to research the patenting of COVID-19 vaccines, and make a timeline of the history, and possible future of vaccine access
- The [third and final project](/illustrator%20projects/university%20projects/DECO2101_Task3_ejes2694.pdf) was done in partnership with Medecin Sans Frontiers. It was to propose an Instagram carousel post to educate people about vaccine access and patents. I chose to use a Monopoly theme for my posts. The posts had to follow MSF's strict style guide.

## School design
Whilst I was at school, I was involevd in the Art and Design Commitee, which ran a week of activities, culminating in 'Illuminate', a night inspired by Vivid where student art and deisng would be showcased.
In my posititon as the IT captain, I created the art work for Art and Design Week 2018 and 2019, which can be seen [here](/illustrator%20projects/school_projects/Art%20and%20Design%20Committee/).

I also sis Multimedia in year 11 and 12, and completed a number of projects (one of which was web design, see bees repository). As part of one of thses projects, I created graphics to represent each of the planets in the solar system. I did this in illustrator, going through and ideation process which can be seen [here](/illustrator%20projects/school_projects/planets%20copy.png)
